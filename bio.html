    <p> <pre><span> Hello all, I've lived in several parts 
        of the United States, but currently reside in Georgia.

        My first foree into coding was a basic HTML/CSS class I 
        took in 2007. Since then I'd kept coding in the back of my mind
        as something interesting to look deeper into as a potential hobby,
        but didn't really start to explore the idea further until 2018.
        
        Since, I have been constantly learning and 
        improving, all for my goal of creating something of 
        lasting value. 
        
        Discovering this coding journey was 
        a result of combining my eclectic passion 
        with the desire to explore the future. 
        
        While continuing on this journey, I am intersted in 
        joining a worthwhile team!</span></pre>
