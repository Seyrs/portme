        Hello all, my name is Seymour, and I am a fan of horror movies, 
        fantasy novels, '80s music and fashion. I've lived in several
        parts of the United States, but currently reside in 
        Atlanta, Georgia. Since 2014 I have been employed in the corporate
        operations department of a cable, security, and a/v equipment 
        distribution company and am now looking to shift into a new lane.

        My first foree into coding was a basic HTML/CSS class I 
        took in 2007. Since then I'd kept coding in the back of my mind
        as something interesting to look deeper into as a potential hobby,
        but didn't really start to explore the idea further until 2018. 
        
        Discovering this coding journey was 
        a result of combining my eclectic passion 
        with the desire to explore the future. 

        Since, I have been constantly learning and 
        improving, all for my goal of creating something of 
        lasting value.
        
        While continuing on this journey, I am intersted in 
        joining a worthwhile team! After finsihing up at the Digital Crafts
        software development cohort/bootcamp in March 2020, I have gained a 
        toolkit of full-stack skills and am open to applying that somewhere 
        that is a nice fit and well help me evolve as a coder.
